Titanic Project:
4 Variables:
-Sex
-Ticket class, (1 being the highest, 3 being the lowest)
-Survival
-Age

Three graphs illustrating the Titanic dataset. 
  1. Bar graph-Compares the number of females to males in different pclasses.
    Conclustions:
      -There were more men than women onboard across all pclasses.
      -The highest ration of women:men was in pclass 3.
  2. Bar graph-Compares the number of females to males in different pclasses, considering those who survived versus didn't survive.
    Conclusions:
      -More women survived than men, across all classes.
  3. Dot plot
    -Compares the pclass to age. 
    -Separate graphs for those who survived and those who didn't. 
    -Separate colors for males and females.
      Conclusions:
        -More young people were in pclass 3.
        -Almost everyone over ages 50 in pclass1, 55 in pclass2, and 65 in pclass3 did not survive.
        -Almost everyone under age 17 in pclass1 and pclass2 survived. That was not true for pclass3.
