**Titanic Project with 4 Variables:**
- sex
- ticket class, (1 being the highest, 3 being the lowest)
- survival
- age

**Three graphs illustrating the Titanic dataset.** 

  **1. Bar graph**
  - Compares the number of females to males in different ticket classes.
  - Comparisons:
    - There were more men than women onboard across all ticket classes.
    - The highest ratio of women:men was in pclass 3.
   
   
   
  **2. Bar graph**
  - Compares the number of females to males in different ticket classes, considering those who survived versus didn't survive.
  - More women survived than men, across all ticket classes.
  
  
  
  **3. Dot plot**
  - Description:
    - Compares the pclass to age. 
    - Separate graphs for those who survived and those who didn't. 
    - Separate colors for males and females.
   - Conclusions:
     - More young people were in pclass 3.
     - Almost everyone over ages 50 in pclass1, 55 in pclass2, and 65 in pclass3 did not survive.
     - Almost everyone under age 17 in pclass1 and pclass2 survived. That was not true for pclass3.
